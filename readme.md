<h3>Cloud Concepts</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>What is Cloud Computing?<b></p>
        <br/>
        <p>The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted
        on the Internet to store, manage, and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer. Before, 
        you'd own the server, the real-estate to house servers, etc.
        With cloud, someone else maintains servers and you configure
        the code.</p>

    <li><p><b>Six Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing<b></p>
        <br/>
        <p>Don't have upfront costs. Sharing costs of servers with other customers. Instead of paying for idle servers, you can scale up or down. Launch within minutes rather than waiting for your own IT. Save money by focusing on customers rather than maintaining data centers. Finally, you can deploy around the globe in minutes.</p>

        <p>3. Infrastructure as a Service. Basic building blocks of cloud IT. Access to networking features and data storage. AWS.</p>
